Description:
--  ffa: free for all
    All of my scripts on this site are free for you to use. Unfortunately, 
    I have less time these days to develop and support them, so they are 
    provided as-in and without support. However, please respect my copyright.

--  aio: all in one
    I've provided the latest versions of these scripts in a single download
    for ease of distribution. The archive will be updated as needed. Please
    do not redistribute the archive or as separate scripts without my
    permission.

--  fac: for a cause
    In lieu of thanks, consider donating to a charity important to you. If
    my scripts save you time, maybe pass the savings onto organizations
    doing good work. I'd love to hear how you're paying it forward.

In other words, I'm just trying to share knowledge with and help out my
fellow AE script heads, so don't blame me if my code doesn't rate. :-)
